/**
 * Sync engine — the heart of local-first:
 *
 * - syncNow(reason): single-flight with a dirty flag (coalesces callers);
 *   cycle = PUSH (batches ≤100 from the outbox, in order) → PULL (delta
 *   with pending-guard) → possible fullResync after a rejection.
 * - push: applied|duplicate → remove from outbox; rejected → dead-letter
 *   + needResync (snapshot + replay of the remaining ops UNDOES the optimistic
 *   effect of the rejected op — delete wins); budgetId mismatch (new data
 *   epoch) → fullResync and STOP the cycle.
 * - network errors / 5xx / 429: retry with backoff 1s→2s→…→60s ±30% jitter;
 *   backoff reset on success / "online" / new op (poke).
 * - fullResync(): snapshot → replay ALL remaining outbox ops
 *   onto the fresh mirror (memory; they still await push) → persist.
 * - boot: hydrate mirror + outbox → WHOSE replica is this? (bootOwnerOk — a stamped replica is
 *   never rendered to another account) → (empty ⇒ snapshot) → REPLAY outbox
 *   (heals a crash between idbAdd of an op and persisting the mirror) → ready → syncNow.
 * - triggers: boot / poke after enqueue (300 ms debounce — catches a reorder
 *   burst) / focus / online / visibilitychange→visible / 60 s interval
 *   while the tab is visible. Installation is idempotent (StrictMode-safe).
 * - status for the UI (Phase 5): getSyncStatus() + subscribeSyncStatus().
 * - E2EE (tier "e2ee" in e2ee.getTierMeta()): SAME cycle, different network path —
 *   push encrypts outbox ops (the outbox stays plaintext!) to /sync2/push,
 *   pull fetches ciphertexts from /sync2/pull and applies them via applyOp
 *   (store.applyRemoteOps), bootstrap = /sync2/snapshot (no DEK ⇒ BootStatus
 *   "locked" → Unlock screen). 409 tier_mismatch from ANY call (v1 and v2)
 *   updates tierMeta from the body and forces a hard re-bootstrap on the right path.

 * Each of those is EITHER the same user's rotated budget (reseed, DB restore, reattach — a new

 * ACCOUNT mid-cycle (the push loop is skipped entirely when the outbox is empty, so its

/**
 * CHOSEN MODEL (simple and RESILIENT — correctness before optimization):
 *
 * EACH tab pushes on its own triggers (enqueue / focus / online / visible
 * / boot / leader interval), and EVERY cycle FIRST absorbs "orphans" from IDB —
 * ops enqueued by ANOTHER tab (outbox.reconcileFromIdb in doCycle).
 * Outbox memory is PER TAB and is read from IDB only at boot, so without
 * this an op enqueued in tab B, which closed before its own push,
 * would be stuck in IDB until a full reload (no live tab would re-read the outbox).
 * Reconcile closes that: the SHARED durable outbox is the source of truth, and any live
 * tab drains it. Server idempotency (the sync_ops guard) dedupes possible
 * double sends (two tabs absorbing the same orphan).
 *
 * The leader (Web Locks, exclusive lock held "forever") gates ONLY the
 * 60 s interval — one tab polls the server in the background instead of N. Closing
 * the leader tab releases the lock → another tab takes it over, immediately runs a cycle
 * (absorbs orphans left by the previous leader) and resumes the interval. No Web Locks
 * ⇒ isLeader=true in every tab (behavior as before — harmless thanks to
 * idempotency + reconcile).
 *
 * BroadcastChannel("enveo-sync"):
 *  - "updated" (after a cycle that changed data): other tabs rehydrate the mirror
 *    from IDB + replay their own outbox (applyPeerUpdate) — they reflect this tab's
 *    sync WITHOUT their own network request,
 *  - "poke" (after a local enqueue): the leader syncs right away (doesn't wait for
 *    the interval). Both sides feature-detect; no channel ⇒ tabs converge
 *    via their own pulls (focus/interval).
 * Loop protection: receive handlers do NOT broadcast (applyPeerUpdate
 * posts nothing and persists nothing).
